# Simple Todo App

A user-friendly Todo application that allows users to create, manage, and track tasks efficiently. This project has been refactored to use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles with JavaScript modules for cleaner, more maintainable code.

## Functionality

The Simple Todo App allows users to:

	•	View a list of pre-loaded hard-coded to-dos.
	•	Add new tasks via a popup form with form validation.
	•	Mark tasks as completed using checkboxes.
	•	Delete tasks when no longer needed.
	•	Generate unique IDs for each task using the uuid package for better management.

## Technology

This project was built using:

	•	HTML for structuring the page elements.
	•	CSS for styling the app with a responsive layout.
	•	JavaScript (ES6) with modules and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to handle task creation, deletion, and validation.
	•	uuid for generating unique IDs for new tasks.

Key Features:

	•	Todo class: Manages individual tasks, including adding new tasks, marking them as complete, and deleting them.
	•	FormValidator class: Handles form validation for adding tasks, ensuring that users can only add valid inputs.
	•	Responsive design: The app works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.
	•	Smooth popup form behavior: Users can easily add new tasks without reloading the page.
